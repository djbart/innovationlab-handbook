# Communication platform

We use [Slack](http://www.slack.com) to communicate & share information. Any SD Worx employee can join our Slack team on [sdwil.slack.com](http://sdwil.slack.com). You can set up a custom channel for a startup team if it can help improve their communication.

# Work management

We advise to use [Trello](http://www.trello.com) as a lightweight & customisable work management tool. You can create boards to manage all work related to a product or team. Our Trello boards are bundled in 1 team account which you can access [here](https://trello.com/sdworxinnovationlab).
